# OmniScope 
## A Python service

_OmniScope_ is a python API that fetches real-world data about any given public figure, and returns a daily thought based on the public goings on of their lives.

This service leverages a Python library for grabbing snippets of search data (from several sources) and creating a first-person perspective based on current events (events pertaining to the figure) as well as historical information about the public figure (sourced from Wikipedia).

The service will rely on a ChatGPT Python client to generate the contextual thought.

OmniScope will be accessible via a React web front-end.
